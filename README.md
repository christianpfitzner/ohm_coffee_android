README

This app sends a name to a CoffeeBot through a server-client connection. 
Each name is deposited with specific coordinates in a previously acquired map.
The app consists of a home page with the existing name. 
If you choose a name you come to a waiting point and have to press a button to come back.
In addition, there is a page with some information.<p>
